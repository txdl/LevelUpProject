        Pollution Pirates
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pollution Pirates is a project thought up by the brilliant students of TXDL. They participated in a 14 week program in which they learned web development, game development, and general programming. The game was built using unity and the website was built from scratch!

              What could be better than trying to beat your friends score and earn bragging rights. How about beating hard mode over all your friends. Well this is my favourite part in the game jumping around as a flying boat! what could be better. you don't need anything else when you can spout wings and fly.

                I am a 23 year old male, who dropped out of high school. I'm a gamer with an interest in programming. I had no idea what I wanted to focus on until I found Level Up! They helped me focus on what I wanted to do. I now know I need to work on javascript and html is fine. I enjoy general design more than coding, something I never thought I would discover here. I know I can achieve what I want, my journey does not stop here it has only begun. They helped me decide which path I want to take and shown me what skills I need to improve. Now I can focus on the future and plan carefully with the knowledge and skills I've gained from here on out.

                Hugo is a young, digital nomad, traveling across Canada to learn outside of books and school institutions, whose long-term goal is to support herself as a digital nomad working on a laptop and going on adventures at the same time. She wants to create fun, educational travel apps that help enhance real world experiences, believing that technology should not overpower living in the physical world. "It's unhealthy to just sit at a computer all day only moving your thumbs, you need to move your arms and legs too. While I like playing Mario occasionally, I'd rather play my own Adventureâ€” that's why my travel apps will help video game lovers learn to see the world through their own eyes and not computer screens."
